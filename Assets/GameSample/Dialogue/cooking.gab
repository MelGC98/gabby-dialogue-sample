[Camilla.Cooking]
    * Camilla has been talking for hours. Or at least, it feels like it.
    * You don't know how it happened, but at some point you ended up in a kitchen, and you're cooking some recipe she mentioned.
    - Right, so... 
    - Are you any good at chopping, or do you like to read?
    : Chopping
        - Aww, that's what I like doing too!
        - But ok, I'll read, you chop!
        - So... Chopping... 
        - You need to find an onion, carrots, celery, a bell pepper... Wait, what color pepper?
        : Let's use red!
        : Let's use green!
        - Okay! So find one of those...
        - Then we also need garlic, tomatoes, parsley, chicken...
        - And calamari?!
        - And mussels too!~ Wow! This has everything in it!
        : I'll cut the vegetables first, and put them in bowls.
            (Player) I'll cut the vegetables first and put them in little bowls, and you can use them when you need them
            (Camilla, very happy) Ok! That sounds like a good idea!

            * You start chopping away, putting the veggies into small glass bowls.
            * Camilla takes this time to read through the recipe.
            * Overall, you get the feeling that things are going pretty well so far.

            <happy>
            - Cool, I think I get it...
            - Oh! And you're all done! Ok, start on the meat next while I fry the veggies.
            > set(camilla.cookingStep1Success, true)

        : I'll cut the meat first and you can fry it right away!
            (Player) I'll cut the meat first and you can fry it right away!
            (Camilla, very happy) Ok! That sounds like a good idea!

            * You cut up the chicken and octopus, and start cleaning the shrimp.
            + Camilla fries everything up as it becomes available, throwing each ingredient in the pan.
            * She looks through the recipe as the meat sizzles.

            <sad>
            - Hmm...
            - We were actually supposed to start with the veggies, so the meat doesn't overcook...
            - And we have to like, <i>suer</i> the <i>mirepoix</i>?
            + What does that even mean?

            * You get the feeling that you could have done better on this step.
            > set(camilla.cookingStep1Success, false)
    : Reading
        - Good idea, you read! I'll start chopping stuff right away!
        - So... What do I need?

        (Player) You need an onion, carrots, celery, a bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, and parsley...
        + Along with calamari, chicken, and some other seafood...

        (Camilla, bored) Dude. That was way too much to remember.
        (Camilla, happy) Where do we start?

        * What do you do first?
        : Suer the mirepoix!
            (Player) Start chopping up the veggies! We'll fry that first.

            (Camilla, happy) Ok!

            * She chops up the mirepoix first at your request, and you get it all into a pan.
            * Everything is cooking up nicely!
            * Overall, you get the feeling that things are going pretty well so far.
            > set(camilla.cookingStep1Success, true)
        : SautÃ© the protein!
            (Player) Cut up the chicken and calamari, I'll start cooking that first!

            (Camilla, happy) Ok!

            * She chops up the protein first at your request, and you get it all into a pan.
            * Everything is cooking up nicely, but...
            * As it fries, you notice that the recipe wants you to start by frying the veggies.

            (Player) Oops...
            (Camilla, annoyed) What oops? No oops!
            - ...
            + No oops!~

            (Player) It's not that big of a deal! It's just, we were supposed to start with the veggies.
            (Camilla, sad) Oh... Well, whatever, let's keep going! We can toss them in now.

            * You toss in the veggies with the meat, letting it all cook a while.
            * You get the feeling that you could have done better on this step.
            > set(camilla.cookingStep1Success, false)
    * It takes some time, but soon everything's looking pretty good, and you're finally ready to move onto the next step.

[Camilla.CookingStep2]
    - Ok, let me take a look at the recipe...
    - So, we add some spices, salt... Then wine!

    * She grabs several spice bottles and the two of you add ingredients one by one.
    * It simmers, the fragrance of the spices wafting through the room.

    - Alright, so next...
    * Camilla looks at the recipe quickly.
    - We have to add the chicken, broth, and rice!
    <sad>
    - ...
    <angry>
    - WE FORGOT TO COOK THE RICE!

    : Use uncooked rice
        > set(camilla.cookingStep2Success, true)
        (Player) I think we should use uncooked rice.
        (Camilla, annoyed) For real? Won't it be all crunchy and hard?
        (Player) No, it will soften in the broth and absorb it.
        (Camilla, very happy) Oh! Ok, let's try it and see!

        * You boil the broth and rice together.
        + It takes a while, but as the broth simmers, the rice softens and soaks it all up.

    : Quickly cook some rice
        > set(camilla.cookingStep2Success, false)
        (Player) I'll cook some rice now! We'll add it as soon as it's ready.

    (Camilla, very happy) Alright, so we can finally add the rest in!
    <happy>
    - Calamari, shrimp, mussels...
    * She throws it all in and stirs it together.
    * Afterwards, she pauses, looking at the heaping pile of food cooking in the pan and enjoying the aroma.

    * She takes a bite, an even bigger smile spreading across her face.
    - It's SO GOOD!~

    * You take a bite too.
    * The flavours are incredible!
    + There's just the right amount of seasoning and so many different spices and textures.
    (Player) Wow, it really is good!

    (Camilla) I can't believe we made something so delicious!
    <very happy>
    - Thanks for your help today!~

    (Camilla, very happy) I can't wait to dig in!
    * She takes a bite.
    * She seems slightly disappointed, but overall happy with the meal.
    - Mm, it's good!
    - It's not as good as the last time I had it but it's still pretty good.
    if cookingStep1Failed()
        <sad>
        - I think we overcooked the meat a little bit.
        - Maybe we should have started with the vegetables?
        * You take a bite too.
        * She's right. It doesn't taste bad, but the meat is a little tough from overcooking.
    else if cookingStep2Failed()
        <sad>
        - The rice is pretty mushy.
        - Maybe we shouldn't have cooked it first after all?
        * You take a bite too.
        * She's right. It doesn't taste bad, but the rice is overcooked.
    <happy>
    - But despite that, it turned out pretty tasty, don't ya think?
    (Player) Yeah, it's still good!
    (Camilla, very happy) Thanks for your help today!~

    * You both eat your fill.
    * It was pretty good!

    (Camilla, happy) See you around!
    end

[Camilla.CookingBadEnding]
    (Camilla, bored) It looks different than last time I had it...
    * She takes a bite.
    * She seems disappointed. She chews it slowly, pondering the flavour and texture.

    (Camilla, sad) Well, we tried...
    <happy>
    - But you know, it's not that bad!
    * She takes another bite.
    - Yeah, I could eat this!
    - The meat is kinda chewy, and the rice is really soggy... But it's still tasty!

    * You take a bite too.
    * She's right. It doesn't taste bad, but the meat is too tough and the rice is too mushy.

    (Player) Well, it's not so bad, and we can just try it again!
    (Camilla, happy) Yeah, we'll try it again!
    - Thanks for your help today!

    * You both eat up.
    * It was good, but you're sure you can do better.

    (Camilla, happy) Let's cook this again sometime. But for now, I'll see you around!
