# The Gabby Dialog Language
Gabby is a simple scripting language for game dialog and visual novels.

Gabby aims to be a highly readable language with few distractions and minimal complexity. This project implements a dialog engine for Unity.

## Repository Structure

gabby-dialog is the root repository for the project, containing everything you need to try the language and learn to use the dialog engine.

[gabby-dialog-engine](https://github.com/zdawson/gabby-dialog-engine) is the repository for the dialog engine itself. If you're using gabby in a game, you probably want to clone this directly into a submodule in your project.
