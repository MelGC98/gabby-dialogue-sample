[Camilla.Lamp]
    * Camilla has been talking for ages.
    * You suddenly realise you have no idea what she's talking about...
    <bored>
    - So I figured, yeah, why not.
    - I'll just pick one and go with it, I mean, worst case scenario I return it to the store, right?
    <happy>
    - So I just bought it!
    - It seems to work just fine and I like the look of it.

    <annoyed>
    - What the-
    <angry>
    - Did the lightbulb just burn out!?
    <annoyed>
    - Ok, no problem, no need to get upset over it Camilla...
    <sad>
    - I mean, I DID just buy it, but...
    <happy>
    - No!
    + It's fine!
    - Hey, could you find a lightbulb please? To fix the lamp?
    (Player) I'm on it!

[Charles.GreetingLampFindLightbulb]
    - Hmm? You're looking for a lightbulb?
    - They should be somewhere in the kitchen.

[LightbulbQuest.FoundLightbulb]
    * Aha!
    * After rummaging around a bit, you find a suitable lightbulb for the lamp.
    (Player) I should take this to Camilla...
    > setQuestStage(lamp, foundLightBulb)

[Camilla.FoundLightbulb]
    (Camilla, very happy) You found one!
    (Camilla, happy)      That's great!
    (Camilla, sad)        Um, hey, could you uh...
    -                     Could you change it too?
    (Camilla, happy)      I kind of had a bad experience once!
    : Yeah, no problem.
    : Alright, fine...
    (Camilla, very happy) You're the best!
    > setQuestStage(lamp, replaceLightBulb)

[Camilla.GreetingLampReplaceLightbulb]
    - Go ahead, change the lightbulb!
    - We can chat later!

[Charles.GreetingLampReplaceLightbulb]
    - Oh, you found one!
    
[LightbulbQuest.ReplaceLightBulb]
    * You unscrew the old light bulb.
    * Yep, that's burnt out alright...
    * Tossing the old bulb into the trash, you screw in the new one.
    * With the flick of the switch, the lamp comes on.
    + It's nice and bright!
    (Player) I should talk to Camilla again.

[Camilla.CompleteLampQuest]
    <very happy>
    - Yay, it's working again!
    <happy>
    - Thanks for taking care of that.
    - What good's a burnt out lamp, anyway?
    - So, where was I... I was at the store, picking a lamp...
    * You get the feeling she'll be talking for a while yet...
