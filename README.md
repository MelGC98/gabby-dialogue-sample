# The Gabby Dialogue Language
Gabby is a simple scripting language for game dialog and visual novels.

Gabby aims to be a highly readable language with few distractions and minimal complexity. This is the root respository for the Unity dialog engine implementation.

This project is a complete reference implementation for a dialogue engine using the language. While it's useful on its own, you're encouraged to extend it as needed or provide your own implementation.

## Repository Structure

gabby-dialogue is the root repository for the project, containing everything you need to try the language and learn to use the dialogue engine.

[gabby-dialogue-engine](https://github.com/zdawson/gabby-dialogue-engine) is the repository for the dialogue engine itself. If you're using gabby in a game, you probably want to clone this directly into a submodule in your project.

Also see [gabby-dialogue-vscode](https://github.com/zdawson/gabby-dialogue-vscode) for VSCode syntax highlighting.
