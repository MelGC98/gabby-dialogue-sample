        (Vendor) This sword belonged to The Great King, Wuh... Wen...
        
        (Camilla, annoyed) Ok, yeah, I forget his name. But he was like a king or something... Anyway.

        (Vendor) This sword belonged to the king. It's a very rare artifact, and, like, incredibly well forged!

    : A bunch of old coins, kind of lame really.
        (Camilla, bored) So like, are these just some old coins that were buried for a long time or something?

        (Vendor) Ah, these are indeed coins from an ancient civilization!
        -        They were found during an archaeological dig years ago.

        (Camilla, bored) Having a hard time sellin' 'em?

        (Vendor) Ah!~ Er..

        (Camilla, bored) I'll offer 25 coins...
        <annoyed>
        +                And that's being generous!

        (Vendor) Uh, sure!
        +        I suppose...

    : Something that looked kind of like an alien weapon!
        (Camilla, very happy) Whoa!

        (Vendor) Interested in the... uh, alien weapon, are you?

        (Camilla, sad) Heh, I forget what he actually called it at the time...
        (Camilla, sad) Sorry...

        (Vendor) Interested in this thing, are you?
        -        Well, you have a good eye!
        -        This item is one of a kind.
        +        In fact, it's not of this world!
        -        I'll take no less than 300 coins for it!

        (Camilla, annoyed) What?! But... I can't afford that!
        (Camilla, angry)   Give me a deal!

        (Vendor) I'm afraid I cannot.

        (Camilla, sad) Lame...

        (Camilla, angry)      But seriously! It was so lame! He wouldn't budge on the price at all.
        (Camilla, sad)        I bet I could've blown up so many things with it... 
        (Camilla, very happy) Anyway! Back to my story!

        (Camilla, sad) What about...

        +        Uhh...

        (Camilla, angry) Ugh! Why'd you pick that one!
        +                I told you I forget!
        -                It was like, lame or something anyway.

        (Vendor) That's not for sale!
        -        Choose something else.
